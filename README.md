# inference
A tensorboard plugin names "inference"

Put it in '/tensorboard/tensorboard/plugins' to activate the plugin.

You will also need to add some declarations of the inference plugin in '/tensorboard/BUILD', '/tensorboard/default.py', '/tensorboard/componets/tf-tensorboard/BUILD', '/tensorboard/componets/tf-tensorboard/default-plugins.html' and '/tensorboard/componets/tf-tensorboard/tf-tensorboard.html', if you want to enable "inference" plugin.
